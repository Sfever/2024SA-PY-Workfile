You're welcomed here to contribute to this repo. However, several important rules and notices should be respected

- ## Everything should on the right place

  Just to keep things __ORGANIZED__ please everyone place right things at right places

  - JSON Storyline files should be placed in [story](/story/)/`storyline name` folder.
  - Except from the `main.py` file, all other codes should be put into [codes](/codes/) folder.
  - Tutuorials and introductions on your storyline should be placed in [etc](/etc/)/`your storyline name` folder.
  - Explaination about codes should be put in the __SOURCE CODE FILE__ directly as comments.
  - The main folder shall not be changed.

- ## Codes should be reasonable

  Nope, no `pytorch` here

  - References to a _new_ library without clear reason could cause your pull request being refused. e.g. using `pytorch` just for fun is not allowed. However, using _new_ library for adding new features, clean codes and other reasonable things is allowed.
  - __Comment-less codes are just garbage.__ Commit Anything with huge chunks of codes without comments is not allowed.
  - Public Repos are not for you to show-off, test and mess around. Please keep codes at a __Resonable Complexity__. Also, although we encourage the usage of new features, please do not use __DRAFT-LEVEL FEATURES__
  - New codes should be published to __*your own branch*__ instead of main

- ## Issues

  - You're welcomed to open a issue here for any problem that __YOU CANNOT FIND A SOLUTION__, search the web before you ask.
  - Codes should run anyway on most platforms, they're tested on Ubuntu, Windows and MacOS
  - They may have bugs, you can always open an issue/pull request on it.
  - Running on Non-Offical python interpreter may cause problems and you need to figure it out yourself. For example, python implentations on iOS or Android.

- ## Be Respect
