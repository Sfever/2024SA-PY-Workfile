# HELLO

Welcome to *Github*, a.k.a *__GAYYYYYYYYYYHUB__*  
For you, it maybe your first exprience of a __*Open-Source*__ Project.  
Meanwhile, it could be your first time to hear about __*Git*__, __*Version Control*__ and some many other things.  
No worry, it will not hurt you... at least for now  

## Something Important

This file is not design for teach you anything.  
__If You Don't like it, just skip it.__  
CS rules:  

- ##  Don't believe in anyone

  I'm not an expert in __Python__, in fact, sometimes I'm doing really shit things in codes. For Example, declear a variable in C++ style:

  ```Python
  int a=42
  ```

  This is far away from the correct form.Which should be this:

  ```Python
  a=int(42)
  ```

  So, if you see me doing anything stupid, __Just Say it Out Loudly.__  
  Don't worry, this will not hurt my heart:) I'm not that weak.

- ### Respect others(and their works)

  You guys probably have no idea what a open source license is, don't worry, it will not be a problem unless you want to use other's work and/or codes in your project.  
  However, for you beginners, I strongly suggest you to use other's work, it reduces your workload and probably easier to do and to use.  
  So, if you are using other's product, make sure you respect their work, lisence and maybe strange requirements. If you don't like it, do it yourself or shut up and follow their rule.  
  For example, if others say their work is under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license, then you should make your codes public available as well. If you don't know what a license refers to, [__STFW__](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm)([__百度一下__](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/main/README-zh_CN.md#rtfm-%E5%92%8C-stfw%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E4%BD%A0%E5%B7%B2%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E6%90%9E%E7%A0%B8%E4%BA%86))

## Commit codes that not following Open-Source licenses will be __DELETED IMMEDIATELY__ and all your action on this repo is no longer acceptable

- ## Learn to use Internet

  Before you starts to dump things in the [Issue's list](https://github.com/Sfever/2024SA-PY-Workfile/issues), please make sure you're asking new, valuable questions. If you open an Issue with something like
  >I can not run the files on iPads!

  or
  >How do I run the game?

  This types of Issue will be __CLOSED IMMEDITELY__ after I discover it, and I __WILL NOT__ explain why. [__STFW__](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#rtfm)([__百度一下__](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/main/README-zh_CN.md#rtfm-%E5%92%8C-stfw%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93%E4%BD%A0%E5%B7%B2%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E6%90%9E%E7%A0%B8%E4%BA%86)) before you start! Issue are used to report __BUGS__ instead of helping absolute rookies to play the game. Anything that is not __BUGS__ should be in the [discussion](https://github.com/Sfever/2024SA-PY-Workfile/discussions), Thank You.
